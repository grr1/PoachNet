Troubleshooting:
- If code will not upload from Arduino editor to Fona, hit reset button on Fona
- GPS needs a clear view to the sky to get a location fix (not indoors).  GPS
  seems to work OK, at least sometimes, through the waterproof container
- If uploading this code to a new Fona, cut the trace on the KEY pin for it to
  work properly with the code provided. That way, the cell module can be toggled
  on/off by a GPIO pin
- If Arduino IDE complains about Serial1 not being declared, make sure you
  selected the board "Adafruit Feather 32u4" in the Tools menu.
- If you are using this software and the Fona will turn on but refuses to send
  texts or perform other functions expected of it, the battery might be
  too low.  Let it charge for a while (maybe a couple hours?) and try it again.
  This sometimes solves unexplainable problems with this device.
- If the device's "dynamic memory" gets too big (even if it's less than 2KB),
  the device might start having weird problems, such as pausing of execution
  or some string variables suddenly having empty contents. Try to not let that
  number get too big.

There is a user guide for PoachNet Lite in the Google Drive folder for this
project.
